Chicago has more lead service lines than any other U.S. city (over 400,000) posing a major public health concern. This project prioritizes replacement efforts using a block groupâ€“level risk model that combines demographic vulnerability (social cost of lead) with infrastructure data (likelihood of lead)

The prioritization method is adapted from a model used by Safe Water Engineering in Washington, D.C.. Replacement priorities are assessed at the block group level, which typically includes between 600 and 3,000 residents. Each block group is evaluated using two key metrics:

Cost of Lead (CoL): A social harm score that reflects the potential impact of lead exposure on vulnerable populations. It incorporates the Area Deprivation Index (ADI), which is a composite measure of socioeconomic disadvantage, and the number of children under 5, who are most at risk from lead exposure
Likelihood of Lead (LoL): The average number of service lines within the block group that are suspected to require replacement.
Each score is normalized on a scale of 1 to 10. By multiplying CoL and LoL, we generate a composite priority score ranging from 0 to 100, identifying which block groups should be prioritized for service line replacement.

CoL Score
CoL = 0.5 * ADI Score + 0.5 * Children under 5 score

Children under 5 score
50+ children:  10
11-50 children: 5
1-10 children:   3
No children:      1 

LoL score
Lead and galvanized lines: 10.
Unknowns: 5
Non-Lead: 0

Model score = CoL * LoL
